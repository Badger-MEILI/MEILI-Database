# MEILI Database

The MEILI Database is the backend storage module for the MEILI System and has the following functionality:

- Storage
    - data collected by the **MEILI Mobility Collector** clients (GPS locations fused with accelerometer readings) 
    - data annotated by the same clients using the **MEILI Travel Diary** (trips and triplegs)
- Functions for
  - CRUD operations for **MEILI Travel Diary**
  - pagination operations for **MEILI Travel Diary**
  - API specific operations for the backend part of **MEILI Travel Diary** 

> The MEILI Database is written (and licensed) for academic purposes, and as such, it is a proof of concept and **SHOULD NOT** be used as it is in production. Complex issues such as performance tunning, security, anonymization and any further development should be addressed by experts before running it in production.
